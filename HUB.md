# about the null home project

this is the main hub project. i need to get enough of it working that i'd be happy living with it as the primary hub. until then this is more of a backup or dev hub project.

## issues

issues with specific automation stuff around the house should be reported in person.

feature requests can be submitted as [issues](https://github.com/sophiathekitty/NullHub/issues) on github.
